# Matrix Operations in Python

This is a program to perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on hard-coded matrices.  
It is something I am still working on, to provide more functions such as determinant calculation and row reduction operations. I will also add functionality to allow for the user to input their own matrices.  
Because the multiplication of matrices is so computationally complex, it would not be practical to use this program to multiply matrices of more than maybe 4 dimensions. I would recommend using NumPy, the inbuilt Python library that supports calculations on  large, multidimensional arrays and matrices.
